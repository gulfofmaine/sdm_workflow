[["future-work-plans.html", "Chapter 7 Future Work Plans 7.1 Planned activities 7.2 Potential Opportunities", " Chapter 7 Future Work Plans 7.1 Planned activities There are a couple of different planned activities that will build from the work we have accomplished so far within the sepcies distribution model projection space. These include: Increasing the scope of the project to include more species. We are currently working to identify additional species, which we will then run through this workflow. Assessing how these ecological changes may in turn influence coastal communities. We are using the results from these modeling efforts to provide community-specific information on vulnerabilities and opportunities associated with climate-driven shifts in fished species. 7.2 Potential Opportunities Along with these specific planned activities, we are also interested in continuing this work within two general arenas. First, we are interested in future opportunities that enable us to increase our understanding of distribution model predictive skill. In doing so, we hope to support the sustained improvement of distribution models, which will increase the accuracy and reliability of information passed along to stakeholders and increase their capacity to plan for and adapt to anticipated ecosystem changes. Second, we are interested in being part of the community that helps address the considerable challenge of visualizing and communicating the uncertainty in these model projection results.
