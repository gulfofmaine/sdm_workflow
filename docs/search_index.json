Here you will find documentation detailing the methods used and the processing steps for down-scaling CMIP6 models for use in species distribution modeling and forecasting efforts. About: This project and its results are the work of the Integrated Systems Ecology Laboratory at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute led by Dr. Kathy Mills. Funding for this project has been provided by: Quick Links For quick access to some of the summary reports use these links: 1. CMIP Bias Corrrection with OISST 2. CMIP Bias Corrrection with SODA 3.

Bias-Corrected Time Lines of Study Regions "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 About the Project", " Chapter 1 About the Project The aim of this project is to use the projected future climate states, as forecast by an ensemble of CMIP6 models, to predict shifts in the distribution and abundances of marine species along the Northeastern United States.

This readme exists to orient users through what files are connected and need to be run to maintain upstream-downstream connections. 2.1 Support Function Sources: For both python and R Workflows the data processing steps were broken down into discrete steps and written as individual functions. R functions for processing bias correction steps can be found here Python functions used to download and process cmip data can be found here 2.2 Accessing Data CMIP6 data was downloaded using climate data operator (CDO) command line tools using the following specifications: 2.3 Preparing Date Keys for CMIP6 Models For some reason the R packages that support NetCDF file handling do not like the calendar structure used by climate models. To still use R as a processing tool the dates for each individual CMIP6 model were extracted and placed into a lookup table that could be referenced to lookup the date values when needed. These lookup tables include the source model, the variable of interest, and the proper dates that go with them. To prepare the lookup table we used a python3 script CMIP6 Variable Date Keys. This file was stepped for each of the four variables to create lookup tables for dates and also to flag models that had inconsistent structures/dates/variables.

For this reason a separate repository dedicated to the pre-processing of different OISST products exists and can be found here. This repo covers the acquisition of OISST daily data from NCEI through the creation of daily climatologies and anomaly timeseries. From these daily datasets we then derived monthly averages to match the time-steps of CMIP6 and SODA data. "],["soda-reanalysis-data.html", "Chapter 4 SODA Reanalysis Data 4.1 Accessing Data 4.2 Data Preparation", " Chapter 4 SODA Reanalysis Data About: The Simple Ocean Data Assimilation ocean/sea ice reanalysis (SODA) dataset was used as our reference dataset for three environmental variables: 1.) Sea Surface Salinity, 2.) Seafloor Temperature, &amp; 3.) Seafloor Salinity. 4.1 Accessing Data SODA monthly data were downloaded as annual NetCDF files from the University of Maryland server, using their linux wget commands. 4.2 Data Preparation "],["preparing-climatologies.html", "Chapter 5 Preparing Climatologies 5.1 Climatology Preparation", " Chapter 5 Preparing Climatologies About: For all data sources the reference period for the climatologies was 1985-2014. This period was chosen because it is the last 30-year period available in the CMIP6 historical period of 1950-2014. 5.1 Climatology Preparation The Daily Climatology for OISSTv2 data was performed separately as part of the OISST Mainstays Workflow using the 1985-2014 reference period. This was then converted to a monthly climatology as part of the processing for bias-correction. SODA monthly climatologies were done for bottom temperature, bottom salinity, surface temperature, and surface salinity in the python3 script: soda climatologies. All CMIP6 climatologies were done using historical model runs, using the same reference period of 1985-2014. These were done for each variable as part of the two rmarkdown workflows: OISSTv2 Bias Corrections &amp; SODA Bias Corrections "],["bias-corrections.html", "Chapter 6 Bias-Corrections 6.1 Performing Bias Corrections", " Chapter 6 Bias-Corrections About: Bias-corrections are an important step in the preparation of CMIP6 data for use in forecasting. This step aims to remove any inherent hot/cold biases from the CMIP6 data that are observed during the range of dates that we have available reference data with which to compare the models to. 6.1 Performing Bias Corrections Bias-corrections were performed by stepping through one of two Rmarkdowns. One for SODA bias-corrections and the other for OISSTv2 bias-corrections. The SODA rmarkdown has a parameter option that lets you select which variable to process, outputting everything according to the selection. Details on individual steps can be found in the Rmarkdown report links: OISSTv2 Bias Corrections &amp; SODA Bias Corrections "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
