# Bias-Corrections

**About:**

Bias-corrections are an important step in the preparation of CMIP6 data for use in forecasting. This step aims to remove any inherent hot/cold biases from the CMIP6 data that are observed during the range of dates that we have available reference data with which to compare the models to.

## Performing Bias Corrections

Bias-corrections were performed by stepping through one of two Rmarkdowns. One for SODA bias-corrections
and the other for OISSTv2 bias-corrections. The SODA rmarkdown has a parameter option that lets you 
select which variable to process, outputting everything according to the selection.

Details on individual steps can be found in the Rmarkdown report links:
