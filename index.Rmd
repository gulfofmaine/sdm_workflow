# Preface{-}

Welcome to the SDM Workflow Repository documentation. Here you will find documentation detailing the methods used and the processing steps for down-scaling CMIP6 models for use in species distribution modeling and forecasting efforts.

**About:**
This project and its results are the work of the Integrated Systems Ecology Laboratory at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute led by Dr. Kathy Mills.

Funding for this project has been provided by:
