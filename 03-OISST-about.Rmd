# OISSTv2 Data

**About:**

## Accessing Data

OISSTv2 Data was downloaded as annual NetCDF files from the [Physical Science Laboratory](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html).

## Data Preparation

OISSTv2 Data is regularly used here at GMRI for a number of projects. For this reason a separate repository dedicated to the pre-processing of different OISST products exists and can be found [here](github.com/adamkemberling/oisst_mainstays). This repo covers the acquisition of OISST daily data from NCEI through the creation of daily climatologies and anomaly timeseries. From these daily datasets we then derived monthly averages to match the time-steps of CMIP6 and SODA data.
